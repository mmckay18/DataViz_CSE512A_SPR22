Visualization Intention:
- Last week, I came across a startling statistic that the US's maternal mortality ratio(MMR) has increased from 2018 to 2019[1]. I was curious about how the US compares MMR to other countries. In these visualizations, I make the naive assumption that GDP correlates with access to advanced resources; thus, the county should have the capability to mitigate so many tragedies. The data was obtained by the Unicef.org[2]. I also decided to go with this dataset because many deceptive visualization examples relate to our humanity (100 years of world cuisine). Social media is riddled with these quick charts and could contribute to the detortion of information.

Deceptive Discription:
## Question: How do the five countries with the highest and lowest GDP in 2020 compare to the US MMR thread from 2000-to 2017?

- I answer this question by plotting the Mortality Ratio normalized by the US for a direct comparison. The five highest GDPs in 2020 are the United States of America, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The five lowest GDPs are Madagascar, Mozambique,  Somalia, South Sudan, and Burundi[3]. I aimed to deceive the reader by first not starting at zero and avoiding giving any context to the population. Further, I attempt to draw the reader's eye to the lowest GDPs and show the US resides with all other high GDPs; giving the wrong impression that the US is similar to its counterparts. Though this is partially true, the US has a worse Maternal Mortality Ratio Rate than all other countries in the subset, as I show in the earnest visualization. I also ordered the country's GDP in 2020, but it is not relevant to the question.

Earnest Visualization:
## Question: How does the five highest and lowest countries' GDP relate to their Maternal Mortality Ratio Rate?

- I calculated the slope of the MMR from 2000-to 2017 to estimate the MMR Rate and plotted a bar chart where the blue and orange represent the highest and lowest countries' GDP in descending order; see the legend. This plot highlights the US as having the worse MMRR than all countries in this dataset, and it is getting worse, concluding that there is some truth to the statistic, but the underlying cause is much more complex. In addition, the bar graph does not start at 0, so it is not apparent which plot is deceptive.
